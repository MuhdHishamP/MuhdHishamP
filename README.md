# Hi, I'm Muhammed Hisham

I'm a recent **B.Tech** graduate with a strong enthusiasm for applying my skills and knowledge in the dynamic and ever-evolving field of technology.
 My expertise lies in developing applications using **Django, React, and Next.js**, which allows me to create seamless **full-stack experiences** by combining the power of **Python and JavaScript**. I'm always eager to explore new technologies and frameworks to enhance my development skills.
